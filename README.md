# Bracket Scorer

Takes NHL playoff bracket predictions and scores them with custom scoring rules per league.
 - The **McKids** leagues scored according to the rules at https://bracketchallenge.nhl.com/how-to-play
 - The **StaplesFamily** leagues gives 1 point for the first rounds and then doubles the points each subsequent round

Results per league are stored for easy viewing in the runner/results directory
 - **Results.txt** contains the actual playoffs results known to date that brackets are being scored againt
 - **"league name"/"owner".txt** contains a breakdown of a bracket owner's predictions, points awarded, and points still available (based on future results)
 - **"league name"/leaderboard.txt** contains the rankings of all players brackets
